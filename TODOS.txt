Problems to fix urgently:
Come up with a solution for constants shared across files

Features to add:
Make sure there are no duplicate players allowed
Allow users to create custom games on a separate screen
Give some sort of you win! Message when the game is won
Add a new game button that brings you back to the welcome screen
Add an optional timer
Add support for resizing the screen
Add a solve button, potentially with features for which players to solve with (sort by games played, WAR, highest OPS/ERA+, average, era, etc.)
Multithreading for looking up answers?
